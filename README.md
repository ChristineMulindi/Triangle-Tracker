#### This is  a project of triangle tracker website, 24th March 2019
#### By CHRISTINE MULINDI
## Description
Triangle Tracker takes the lengths of three sides and determines if they form a valid triangle. If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make either an equilateral triangle or an isosceles triangle or a scalene triangle. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* git clone https://github.com/ChristineMulindi/Triangle-Tracker.git
* cd Triangle-Tracker
* atom .
## BDD
This app is therefore expected to work as following:
Be able to display an input button for the user.
Display a click to check function.
If the values entered by the user are all equal,the result should be Equilateral triangle.
If the user enters two equal sides, the result should be Isosceles triangle.
If the user enter values that aren't equal, the result should be Scalene triangle.
And if the values entered by the user are quite unrealistic to make a triangle, the the result will be not a triangle.
